Hey, so this is officially my first ever personal blog post. Here I would like to tell you about myself a little bit. Soooo, I am an 18-year-old software developer. That should be enough, right? 

Alright alright, here goes nothing. 

I was born in 2001 on a small island in the middle of the Mediterranean, and about 6 months later, moved to Russia (or rather my parents picked my lil ass up and moved me there). So, my fun life begins, I went through 3 kindergartens, growing up, learning to walk, and all that cool stuff. Once it was time for me to start school, my parents decided to once again move me back to Cyprus to get the "amazing" European education. So I started school and went through all the stages of the astonishingly fun teenage life, and because shuffling kindergartens seemed not enough, I also went to 3 different schools, smaaaart. I was growing up as a normal teenage kid of this generation, arguing with parents, sneaking out, being a dumbass and the list goes on. All this continued all the way up to when I was around 16.5, and that's when my life took a complete 180.

In May 2018, I met a person who completely changed my life (sometimes it even seems like before that point, I was living a different life, like seriously). So a week after I met her, she became my girlfriend, and things got crazy. Coincidentally, around the same time, my parents got divorced, which kind of led me to just slowly becoming independent. So on our 2 months, we were already living together at her place and already have had a trip together. Fast forward to our 6 months, and I proposed `crazy right, I just turned 17`. Fast forward to May 2019, and at this point, I was finishing school and started working on my first job as a Junior Front End Developer, my mom really wanted me to go to Uni, which I was never a huge fan of, but I applied anyway. So time went on and I got accepted as an Advanced Entry Student. I was due to start, so went for my first day and never came to that place again, it just wasn't for me :P \
My mom was a bit disappointed, but understood. Two months later I got a new job as a Software Developer for a large FinTech company and was happy as never before. The same month we moved out and upgraded from GF/BF to Husband and Wife hehe. It truly felt like a high point, and in all honesty, it was. Boy oh boy were things about to twist hard.

Fast-forwarding to the COVID situation, I was let go due to some managerial decisions. Felt like crap and stayed at home, now it felt like a low point, well at least my wife was there to support me, and our puppy to entertain us both. A month later, I got a call, and started running around, I was offered a job...with almost double my previous salary... So this was 2 weeks ago, and today I created this blog, don't judge too harshly as it's my first attempt with this stuff let's see what comes next.

So, it has been a year, I did get some things done and some nice new projects, but I actually didn't finish any of the projects fully. I have a bunch of stuff that is actually 80%-90% done, and as usual I can't seem to get my shit together and actually finish something. Sad thing is actually some of the stuff that I am doing could actually turn out great, it's starting to get a bit depressing that I can't finish shit.

Anyways, the thing I am working on now is basically a better version of our local marketplace. This project is really close to being done and for some reason I have completely dropped in the recent months. Buuuut, we have a daughter coming!!!! And honestly this is probably the most exciting event that has ever happened in my life, another great thing about it, I am actually finally starting to get motivated again since this is a huge responsibility. I am really hoping to finish my projects, at least one of them. So....

I am setting a deadline for myself, to roll out a fully done first version for testing by the end of June. End of July I want to have a fully done working product shipped to end users. Let's get this done!!!

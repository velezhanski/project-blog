So, already more than a month ago I have set out a goal for myself to start my first ever company, in which the first step was finding a client, which I gave myself a month to accomplish. Well, it took a couple of days... 

So I got my first client along with the budget approved, aaaaand, gave up. Seriously that even sounds dumb to write, but yeah, I've given up on it completely and just stayed comfortable with my salary. And now it all kind of came crashing down on me, with what am I even doing, just being pretty much a lazy ass doing nothing, but normal day to day work. 

I think it's about time to actually once again gain some momentum and continue the work. Not only do I have an obvious incentive (MONEY), but also I do have quite a few interesting ideas in mind. So hopefully the next post will be about the project that I am working on and how I built it. Until then peace out, this was just a quick small rant to myself about myself.

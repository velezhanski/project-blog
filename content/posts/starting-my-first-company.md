Hey friend, hope all is well, so I am thinking to start my first ever company. It has always been my dream to do so, but always seemed scary and somewhere far away. But at this point where I am responsible for my family and want to provide an actual good living, rather than an okay survival, thus I have to do this. 

The whole idea is quite simple;

* Find the first client
* Use the gained funds to kickstart the company
* Start gaining clients and funds
* Hire people to do the work
* Be happy

Seems like quiet an easy plan, yet scary and potentially very hard. Since I live in a small country, and the local companies rarely have a modern mindset, this could be both both a blessing and a curse. Why? Because it will be hard to find a client and convince them, although it is possible and there are lot's of businesses (especially the smaller once, that would need such services). I am not sure where it will take me but definitely, but I don't really have a choice. What do you think?

The idea is to provide some of the more modern technology, and give out a kind of revolutionary and new age branding of the company. I am thinking of using Node.JS for the projects, as it's really diverse, fully custom and really fast. I have tried out things such as GatsbyJs, NuxtJs, Sanity and more. I am hoping that showing this type of approach will convince some clients to choose my agency over a more old styled company building their websites on crappy WordPress templates.

I am aiming to get the first client by calling some of the smaller business that I find don't have a website, either through searching online, or just maybe finding one on the streets. It doesn't really need to be anything large or complicated, just a small project that will give me a headstart and some confidence as well :P

The ultimate goal is to find a client by the end of June, else failure. I will keep you updated, don't worry.
